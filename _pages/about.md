The bulk of all Swedish parliamentary records – debates, bills, motions, committee reports et cetera – have been digitized during the last decade. This material constitutes a rich source to study political culture and democratic development. However, the lack of thorough metadata structure and linked parliamentary data, and the patchwork of gaps and digitization errors, leaves behind a somewhat primitive research infrastructure. Together with the Riksdag Library, the purpose of SWERIK is to address these limitations by constructing a research corpus with an ecosystem of linked open data of the bicameral and unicameral Riksdag, from 1867 until today.

This purpose will be operationalized through four work packages (WP1–4). WP1 will identify members of parliament (MP) in the parliamentary records and assign them metadata in a database format. WP2 will create a linked infrastructure where parliamentary records are linked to MPs. Furthermore, MPs will be connected to external sources (Wikidata, biographical entries, Twitter accounts). WP3 will align the annotated corpus with ParlaMint – an international infrastructure standard for marking up parliamentary data, which enables researchers to compare national parliaments. WP4 will integrate the SWERIK corpus with the Riksdag user interface. The SWERIK corpus will be given a free CC BY-license, and the Riksdag Library will be responsible for storing and maintaining the corpus after the project has ended.
